# React Frontend

This folder hosts the lightweight React dashboard used to follow the execution
of plans generated by OrchestrAI. It purposely has no build step or bundler so
it can run from any static file host such as Firebase Hosting or a local HTTP
server.

---

## ✨ Overview

The dashboard connects to the OrchestrAI API and provides:

* **Task graph visualization** for planning and execution phases.
* Buttons to **resume** or **retry** plans when some tasks failed.
* A fullscreen dark interface inspired by Streamlit.
* Optional HTTP basic authentication using `secure_server.py` for public demos.

## Folder Structure

```
react_frontend/
├── app.jsx        # React components and main logic
├── index.html     # Entry point with React / Babel CDN
├── style.css      # Dark theme and layout rules
├── secure_server.py  # Lightweight HTTP server with authentication
└── README.md
```

The `firebase.json` file at the repository root points to this folder to ease
deployment on Firebase Hosting.

---

## Quick Start

1. Make sure the backend API is running (see the main README).
2. Start a simple HTTP server from this directory:

   ```bash
   cd react_frontend
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your browser.

The dashboard targets `http://localhost:8000` by default. To reach another API
instance, set `window.BACKEND_API_URL` or, preferably:

```html
<script>
  window.CONFIG = { BACKEND_API_URL: "https://your-backend" };
</script>
```

before loading `app.jsx`.

### Using `secure_server.py`

To quickly password-protect the page:

```bash
cd react_frontend
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=myuser BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=mypass python secure_server.py
```

`PORT` selects the listening port (defaults to 8080).

## Development and Customization

This frontend uses React, ReactDOM, Vis Network and Marked via CDN. The
`app.jsx` file is compiled on the fly by Babel in the browser so no Node tools are required. For larger projects you can create a Node environment and use
`npm` or `yarn` to introduce a proper build process.

Node colors are defined in `app.jsx` through the `TYPE_COLORS` dictionary. The
`style.css` file controls the overall look and can be edited to fit your theme.

### Node Colors

In the Team&nbsp;2 execution graph:

* the border color indicates the task type (`executable`, `exploratory`,
  `container`, `decomposition`);
* nodes that spawned sub-tasks have a thicker border.

---

## Firebase Hosting Deployment

1. Install the Firebase CLI and log into your project.
2. From the repository root, run:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

Hosting will then serve the files from the `react_frontend` folder.
